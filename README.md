# 417Interpreter

build.sh and run.sh may have some issues with the '\r' character from windows.

I ran dos2unix on both successfully, but I am unsure if the updated files were commited to the repository properly.

If there are errors with the bash scripts:
1. sudo apt-get install dos2unix
2. dos2unix bash.sh and run.sh

Thank you!
